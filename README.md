## CASE STUDY : ANALYSIS OF SUPERSTORE DATABASE

Before venturing on to any data science project it is important to pre-process the data and also to explore the data. Today we will discuss a very basic topic of exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and also uncover how simple EDA can be extremely helpful in performing preliminary data analysis.

Business managers, including executives and decision-makers, would be interested in understanding the overall performance of the superstore. They would want insights into sales trends, profitability, inventory management, and potential areas for improvement. : This analysis can help inventory and supply chain managers optimize their stock levels, forecast demand, and reduce inefficiencies. Customer service representatives may use the analysis to identify common customer complaints or issues, helping them provide better support and service.

The data analysis could uncover areas where the superstore is underperforming or facing challenges. The solution would involve identifying specific strategies to optimize performance, such as focusing on high-margin products, streamlining inventory management, or improving customer service processes. The data analysis project provides valuable insights derived from factual data rather than relying solely on intuition or assumptions. This enables the superstore to make informed decisions based on evidence, reducing the risk of costly mistakes.
